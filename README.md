# Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Locator

## Overview
The **Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Locator** is a my masters thesis project designed to help individuals quickly locate defibrillators during cardiac emergencies on campus. This project involves a mobile application that detects AEDs in real-time, providing users with the nearest location to an available device. The aim is to make defibrillators more accessible and ensure swift action in life-threatening situations.

## Key Features
- **Real-time AED Location Tracking**: The mobile app helps users find the nearest defibrillator by using location-based services.
- **Emergency Response Assistance**: Provides guidance on how to use an AED during a cardiac emergency.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, even in high-stress situations.

## Design Process
The design of the AED Locator app has gone through several iterations, created using **Figma**. These design iterations have focused on improving the user experience and making sure the app is accessible during emergencies.

### Design Highlights:
- **Simple, Clear UI**: Ensures ease of use, even under pressure.
- **Location Map**: Interactive map that shows the user’s location and the nearest defibrillators.
- **Responsive Design**: The design adjusts to various screen sizes to provide a seamless experience across devices.

## Current Implementation
This project showcases the application’s progress so far, including the completed design iterations and the ongoing development of the app. The implementation focuses on integrating the location features and preparing the app for real-time updates.

## Future Development
- **Enhanced AED Database**: Expansion to include more locations and real-time updates of AED availability.
- **Push Notifications**: Alerts for users to notify when they are near a defibrillator.
- **Integration with Emergency Services**: Collaboration with local emergency response teams for quicker assistance.

## Conclusion
The AED Locator app aims to provide a critical tool for saving lives by improving the accessibility of defibrillators in campus environments. This project combines thoughtful design and practical functionality to enhance emergency preparedness.
